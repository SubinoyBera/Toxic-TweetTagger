## 🔒 Key Security Practices

### 1. *Logging and Monitoring:*
   - *Secure Logging:* Logs are stored securely with restricted access.
   - *Activity Monitoring:* Continuous monitoring for suspicious activity or unauthorized access.

### 2. *Adversarial Attack Mitigation:*
   - *Input Validation:* Ensures inputs conform to expected formats to prevent adversarial attacks.
   - *Adversarial Detection:* Basic defense mechanisms to detect anomalies or adversarial patterns.
   - *Robust Training:* Models are trained with adversarial robustness techniques to handle edge cases.

### 3. *Dependency and Code Management:*
   - *Dependency Scans:* Regular scans to identify and patch vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
   - *Version Locking:* Dependencies are locked using requirements.txt to avoid unintended updates.
   - *Code Reviews:* All code changes are peer-reviewed to maintain code quality and security.

### 4. *Deployment Security:*
   - *Container Security:* If using containers, ensure images are scanned for vulnerabilities.
   - *Environment Isolation:* Separate environments for development, testing, and production.
   - *Secrets Management:* Sensitive keys and secrets are stored securely (e.g., using environment variables or vault solutions).

## 🛡️ Disclosure Policy
Responsible disclosure policy is adopted. Once a vulnerability is reported:
1. The report is acknowledged and validated.
2. The reporter will be kept updated on the status of the fix.
3. A public disclosure may be made only after the issue is resolved to prevent exploitation.
